# Welcome to the Universes Within Collection

The "Universes Within Collection" (UWC) aspires to be a community-created set of Universes Within alternatives (proxies) to be used in place of Universes Beyond cards.

**Check out [the card gallery](https://madelson.github.io/universes-within-collection/).**

## Purpose & Goals

While Magic's Universes Beyond cards have many interesting mechanical designs, for me many of the IPs don't mesh well aesthetically with other Magic cards. Wizards has created the concept of "Universes Within" variants in part to address this issue, but they have also made it clear that there is no plan for Universes Within printings to keep up with the ever-growing list of new Universes Beyond cards.

The Universes Within Collection is an attempt to cover some of the ground that Wizards won't by building out a set of community-created Universes Within variants and making them easy to access.

UWC cards are designed with a few goals in mind:
1. _100% rules compatibility with the Universes Beyond originals._ These are not custom cards.
2. _Clear linkage to the original card to minimize confusion._ When renaming cards, the "Nickname" frame is used to clearly-but-unobtrusively reference the original name, and the collector's number is also linked like it is on official Universes Within cards.
3. _Blend in with traditional Magic cards._ References to Earth and/or non-Magic IPs should be removed, except where it violates one of the other goals.

## Contributing

I don't know if there will be interest, but I'd love to get contributions from others in the MTG community! 

Contributing requires making a [free GitHub account](https://github.com/join). To make any of the contributions below, simply [create an issue](https://github.com/madelson/universes-within-collection/issues/new) describing the contribution you'd like to make and attaching any materials.

There are a ton of cards to cover so I have a strong bias towards accepting contributions. However, as the project creator, I do reserve the right to make the final call on subjective matters like quality/appropriateness/etc.

### Adding new cards

When it comes to creating UWC variants of cards, my goal is to make as few changes as possible. If a card's name fits just fine with traditional Magic, I'd like to keep it to minimize confusion. The same goes for art which sometimes is fine either as-is or with cropping.

In your issue, let me know the name of the card you'd like to add along with any parts of it that should be changed (new name and/or new art). I've found that the most time-consuming aspects of this is linking up Universes Beyond cards with fitting new art and/or names, so this is a huge help. See the [artists page](TODO) for art options.

If you'd like to go the full mile, you can take the extra step of using [MTGCardBuilder](https://mtgcardbuilder.com/) to assemble the card.

### Sourcing art

My goal for this project is to use _high-quality human art with permission from the artist_ (public domain art is great too!). See the [artists page](TODO) for who has been contacted so far.

You can help by identifying artists on platforms like [ArtStation](https://www.artstation.com/) or [Cara](https://cara.app/) whose art could be useful to the project, and linking their info in an issue.

If you have other ideas about how or where to acquire art for the project, I'd love to hear about that as well.

### Something else

Is there a typo in a posted card? Want to make the gallery look nicer? Just create an issue with your idea.

## FAQ

### What about aspects of Magic IPs that are baked into rules-relevant parts of the cards?

It isn't uncommon for Universes Beyond cards to sport [IP-specific types](https://scryfall.com/card/pip/126/agility-bobblehead) or [IP-specific keyword mechanics](https://scryfall.com/card/ltr/43/birthday-escape). These unfortunately can't be removed without breaking rules compatibility, but when selecting are for a re-concepted card these can be treated as blank/wildcard.

Note that cards that reference [IP-specific tokens](https://scryfall.com/card/pip/110/moira-brown-guide-author) can be addressed by creating a renamed UWC variant of the token and referencing that.

Also note that [ability words](https://scryfall.com/card/pip/32/jason-bright-glowing-prophet) (which have no rules impact) may be removed.
